# Qonquest 2
A turn-based map strategy game. Sequel to my earlier terminal game Qonquest (this time with graphics!)
## Changelog
### 2.0.1
* Fixed a few small bugs
### 2.1
* Added the new map by PL\_ADI
* Added text outline for extra visibility
* Moved the "close" button in the battle window to the top so you can actually close the windows
* Fixed a few bugs with reloading the game after a restart
* HOPEFULLY fixed a bug on windows where you wouldn't be able to deploy or move troops
